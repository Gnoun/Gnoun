# Welcome!

I'm not a typical GitHub user. I'm not familiar with programming languages apart from remnants of my past C++ knowledge I haven't used since 2020. I also know a bit of markup languages, such as HTML or Markdown, the latter of which I use consistently to describe projects of mine, especially on my *[website](https://gnoun.net)*.

## Apart from being a musician, I'm creating a [constructed language](https://github.com/Gnoun/Daikova) and develop [math tools](https://gnoun.net/math).

The music and conlang I work on are largely unavailable and constantly in development, contrary to the tools which are publicly available and rather not to be updated anymore.

## My passions

| Passion | date started | current state¹
|:-|:-|:-
| Piano playing | 2018 (Apr 7) | Learning to read sheet music since 2 April 2022 (unfortunately); skill level: close to *Prelude in G Minor* (Rachmaninoff).
| Music composing | 2019 (early) | Composed 46 electronic music pieces with total length of 1:58:43.
| Mathematics | 2019 (early / Apr 9) | Self-learned most of calculus; suspended self-learning math in 2021; currently re-establishing connection with math.
| Language learning | 2019-2020² | B1-B2 level in Spanish and Russian (I'm also a Polish native speaker and my English is at least at C1) (as for my own language – I remember perhaps a couple hundred words).
| Conlanging | 2020 (Dec 27) | Getting close to 2k words; getting unusual with grammar features and considering an internal history (see also: [external history of my language](https://github.com/Gnoun/Daikova/blob/main/history_external.md)).
| Writing | 2010s; left in 2018; returned in 2021 (Apr 23) | Wrote a 60-page long story since return, otherwise not much progress.

² exploring languages since 2019; started learning Spanish on 21 Feb 2020; started learning Russian on 29 Aug 2020 (school aside)

### Secondary passions

I also like to listen about history, psychology and perhaps philosophy, solve problems, order things, and take control of every hour of my life.

I once used to make weird math [graphs](https://gnoun.net/graphs) and have a collection of self-taken [photos of insects](https://gnoun.net/other/other/photos).
